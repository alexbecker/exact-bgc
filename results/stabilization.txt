This document records the value of n at which H^i(PConf_n(C)) stabilizes.

  i  |  n  
-----------
  0  |  1
  1  |  4
  2  |  7
  3  |  10
  4  |  13
  5  |  16
  6  |  19
  7  |  22
  8  |  25
  9  |  28
  10 |  31

All these values stabilize at 3i+1. In addition, with the obvious exception of i=0, at 3i the only missing
component of the decomposition is V(i+1, 1, ..., 1) with i-1 1's.
